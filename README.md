SWEN-755 (Software Architecture) Coding Assignment #2 - Active Redundancy

Group Members:

Our assignment does not use any external frameworks or dependencies. It runs on pure Java 8.

To run our program you need only use the 'compile.sh' script in the root directory of the project.

Alternatively you can run the project by compiling and running the 'NavigationMonitor.java' file.

Our project implements both RMI client/server functionality, and active redundancy for a potential Navigation System Monitor process that monitors the GPS and Navigation systems.

It also fixes the console read problem/implementation from our Assignment #1. The program now reads and writes from RMI server ports(1099).
